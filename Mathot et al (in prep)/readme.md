# About

This archive contains stimulus materials for:
	
- Mathôt, S., Siebold, A., Donk, M., & Vitu, F. (in prep). *Large Pupils Predict Goal-driven Eye Movements*.

Due to size constraints, the stimuli have been uploaded to FigShare and can be found here:
	
- Dataset 1: http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.803040
- Dataset 2: http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.803091

In each image, a small 'z' or 'h' is embedded (14x14 pixels). The locations of these targets is listed in `dataset[X]\targetLocations.txt`.

For Dataset 2, only the fractals have been uploaded, because the images used do not have a license that permits redistribution. The full 'campus set' can be downloaded from <http://www.cps.utexas.edu/natural_scenes/db.shtml>. To obtain our selection including embedded targets, please contact <s.mathot@cogsci.nl>.

The saliency maps are available in the folders `dataset[X]\saliency` as gray-scale `.png` images.

Again due to size constraints, the pupillary luminance maps have not yet been uploaded. Once they are converted to a more manageable format they will be made availabke.

For more details, refer to the (supplementary methods of the) manuscript.
