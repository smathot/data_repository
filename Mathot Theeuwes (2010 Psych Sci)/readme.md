This archive contains the data of individual participants and the summarized data for one experiment. Full experimental details are described in:

Math√¥t, S., & Theeuwes, J. (2010). [Gradual remapping results in early retinotopic and late spatiotopic inhibition of return][ms]. *Psychological Science*, *21*(12), 1793-1798. doi:10.1177/0956797610388813

Data format
===========

summary.csv should be self explanatory. data.csv contains a lot of columns, but the most important ones are 'sacc_lat', 'step1_dur', 'cond', 'loc', 'FILE', and 'correct'. Please note that the subject numbering does not match between both files, due to sorting.
