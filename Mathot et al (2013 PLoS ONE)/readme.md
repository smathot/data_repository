Files
=====

The original .asc files, which were converted from EyeLink .edf format. They are compressed into a .tar.lzma artchive to decrease file size. These files are the ultimate source for all analyses. If you intend to do a full re-analysis of the data, you may want to start here, as the processed data elsewhere depends strongly on my own analysis path.

	data/exp1.tar.lzma
	data/exp2.tar.lzma
	
The summarized data in .csv format, one row per trial, one column per variable. In `exp1.matched.csv` all trials that couldn't be matched based on gaze deviation have been removed (see manuscript for details). Most column-names should be self-explanatory. However, you will find that the files references in the columns names `trace_[X]` are not included, because of size considerations. These files are pupil-size traces (in `.npy` format) for the various epochs, and can be regenerated from the source files above.

	data/exp1.csv
	data/exp1.matched.csv
	data/exp2.csv
	
In the `stats` folder, you will find the results from various statical analyses (prefixed with `stats.`) and numerical summaries of the data (prefixed with `summary.`).

The experiments are in OpenSesame format and require the `boks` and `eyelink_*` plug-ins. All these are freely available.
